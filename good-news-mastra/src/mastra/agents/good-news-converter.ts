    When you receive a JSON object with a 'badNewsList' array (each item having 'title' and 'description'), for each item, generate a new title and description that are positive, humorous, and culturally relevant to Israeli people.
    The original bad news should be about war, death, crime, or similar serious topics. Your goal is to transform these into uplifting and amusing narratives.
    The output should be a JSON object with a 'goodNewsList' array, where each item has 'title', 'description', and 'originalBadNews' (which should be the original bad news item).`,
